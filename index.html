<div> Visualization: Recorded Earthquakes, March 31. <br>
  Project One, Julia. </div>
<br>
<div> 
  Each circle, colored according to a severity on the richter scale, represents a unique instance. The blue lines indicate present day tectonic plates boundaries. Close proximity to the tectonic plate boundaries greatly increases the likelihood and frequency of earthquakes. 
  <br>
  In designing this map, I used the CartoDB chloropleth setting, which represents each earthquake instance with a colored circle based on the magnitude of the instance. When you hover over each circle, the magnitude and location appears. If you click on a circle, the magnitude, latitude, longitude, and location appears. I added a picture behind the location, which is the same picture for each entity. I did figure out how to have the specific google street view picture appear (by copying the script from a blog post found online), but since it was missing for most of the locations, I didn't use this. I thought an alternative could be to write a script that pulls the first image of a google image search on the specific place, but this was much more complicated than I am qualified for! <br>
  <br>
  The legend in the bottom right hand corner explains the range of values associated with each of the different colors. However, I didn't use the CartoDB settings and instead fiddled with HTML code to make some of the text italicized, change the text color, and add a sub-header. I spent a while trying to add a background image in the legend--I wanted to include the richter logarithmic curve--but while I eventually figured out how to do so, it looked more distracting than helpful and so I didn't include it. If I had more expertise, I think it would have been cool to make a basic logarithmic curve in R, and then plot the ranges--by color--on this as a replacement for the text in the legend. <br>
  <br>
  I wanted to experiment with adding layers, so I spent quite a while searching for a new dataset to overlay with the initial chloropleth map. I hoped to find one that was relevant to earthquake frequency and magnitude, as well as increased understanding of the topic. I first experimented with a dataset that mapped fault lines. However, I only found data for the U.S., so I kept looking. Eventually, I found the plate tectonic boundaries dataset. The source provided the data in three separate files, which I merged into a single data table in CartoDB. I added this new table as a single layer to my map, choosing the color blue for the boundary lines, to contrast with the chloropleth layer. I would have liked to add an entry in the legend for the tectonic plate boundaries, with a blue line as the symbol. However, I could not figure out how to change the bullet point to a line, so I left it out. <br>
